# Street_light_project
This project uses a scikit-learn Decision Tree Classifier within a Pipeline to predict the optimal state of a smart streetlight (Dim, Off, or On). It utilizes sensor data like ambient light, solar output, time, weather, battery, motion, and traffic. The model, trained with balanced class weights, is deployed using Streamlit via GitHub
